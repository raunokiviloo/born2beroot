-- INSTALLATION  / GENERAL --

- Need to sign drivers when UEFI Secure Boot enabled. Binaries loaded at boot (e.g. drivers) are
validated against keys located in firmware. Most x86 hardware is preloaded with Microsoft keys,
users can add their	own custom keys as well. Had to do this to get VBox to work.

- Kernel - program at the core of an OS, in a separate mem area called "kernel space" - as opposed
to "user space" where the rest of the programs reside. Facilitates interaction between software and
hardware, manages resource allocation. "System Call" - when a process requests a service from the Kernel.

- x86 - Family of instruction set architectures based on *86 intel microprocessors. "Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA)" - defines the behavior of machine code -> e.g. instructions, data types. A device
that follows an instruction set is called an "implementation". This is why I can upgrade from Ryzen3900x
 to i7-12700k without issues - both follow same ISA.

- PATH - A user's PATH consists of a series of colon-separated absolute paths that are stored in plain
text files. Whenever a user types in a command at the command line that is not built into the shell or
that does not include its absolute path and then presses the Enter key, the shell searches through
those directories, which constitute the user's search path, until it finds an executable file with that
name.

- Daemons - Background programs that take care of some subsystem / functionality, e.g. printing, networking.
Windows equivalent is services.

 -- SUDO --

- Shorthand for "substitute user & do" or "superuser do". Allows us to execute commands as root without
having to "su -l" every single time.

- Configuring sudo -> Can either edit /etc/sudoers file or create a new file in /etc/sudoers.d/. "sudo visudo".
sudo -k -> Log out of sudo
Defaults passwd_tries=n -> Number of times you can retry entering passwrd.
Defaults badpass_message="custommessage" -> Set custom wrong pw message.
Defaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin -> Prevent potentially compromised PATHs being used.
Defaults requiretty -> Sudo can only be used from a logged in terminal session - not by web-plugins, daemons.
Defaults log_output, log_input -> Log both sudo inputs and outputs.
Defaults iolog_dir=<path>

-- USERGROUP MANAGEMENT --

- Create new user -> sudo adduser <username>
- Create new group -> sudo addgroup <groupname>
- Add user to group -> sudo adduser <username> <groupname>
- Rem user from group -> sudo deluser <username> <groupname>
- Get database entry pertaining to user / group -> getent <dbname> <name>

-- HOSTNAME MANAGEMENT --

- Change hostname -> hostname <newhostname>
- Permanently change hostname -> Edit /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files.
- Apply changes without rebooting -> sudo /etc/init.d/hostname.sh start

-- Logical Volume Manager (LVM) --
 - Physical volume -> A physical storage unit, e.g. hard drive or a partition on a hard drive.
 - Volume group -> A storage pool that can consist on many PVs.
 - Logical volume -> Like partitions on windows, utilize VG storage across PVs, can be resized at will while working.
 - Mounting -> Associating storage (e.g. a LV) with a particular location in the directory tree.
 - Creating LVs -> sudo lvcreate -L <size> -n <LVname> <VGname>
 - Formatting LVs -> sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<VGname>/<LVname>
 - Mounting LVS:
				1. sudo mkdir -p /mnt/<LVname> -> Create directories, if needed.
				2. sudo mount /dev/<VGname>/<LVname> /mnt/<LVname> -> Mount LV to a path.
				3. sudo nano /etc/fstab -> Edit to make mounts persistent (automount at boot). See below.
				4. /dev/<VGname>/<LVname> <mount path> ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0

-- SSH --

- Secure Socket Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that allows us to securely access a device over an
unsecure network. Uses passwords, public key cryptography and data encryption.
- Configure SSH -> sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- Disable using SSH as root -> PermitRootLogin no
- Check SSH status -> sudo systemctl status ssh
- Connect over SSH -> ssh -p <port> <username>@<ip>
- Set up new SSH account -> ssh-keygen -> ssh-copy-id -i <keypath> -p <port> <user>@<ip> Adds all keys if no -i.

-- UNCOMPLICATED FIREWALL (UFW) --

- Previous gen firewalls only looked at packet headers (source and dest.). Next gen FWs also look at packet contents.
- Change default policy to deny external traffic -> sudo ufw default deny
- Allow traffic to a particular port -> sudo ufw allow <port>
- Allow rate-limited traffic (block when >6 connection attempts in 30s) to port -> sudu ufw limit <port>
- Enable UFW on system startup -> sudo UFW enable

-- PASSWORD POLICY --
1. Password expiry config -> sudo vi /etc/login.defs -> See pwquality man.
2. Change password -> sudo passwd <username>
3. Display password expiry information -> sudo chage -l <username>



-- DEFENSE --
- Please note that your virtual machineâ€™s signature may be altered after your first evaluation. To solve this problem,
you can duplicate your virtual machine or use save state.

1. What is appArmor?
2. What is SELinux?
3. What is the difference between aptitude and apt?
4. Set up a new SSH account!
5. Create a new user and add it to a group!
6. Explain how monitoring.sh works and interrupt it without modifying it. Take a look at cron!
7. Explain extra service choice for website!
